#Hello there. Welcome to my github where I place most of my university coding assignments. Please do not plagarize my work as there can be serious consequences with the university that I do not wish to be held responsible for. This is solely for educational purposes only and to help myself keep track of the work and assignments I have done thus far in my academic career.
